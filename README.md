This code consists of three R files,three Python files and three data files

First, you need run three R code files in Rstudio, then three Python code files, with data files loaded in between as needed. The code functions of each file are as follows:

1.download_pro.R   
	The main function is to download SNP data of GSE28127 from GEO
	
2.SNPDataAnalysis.R	
	SNP data preprocessing.Missing values should not exceed 20%, and less than 20% should be filled with the most frequent data.Then SNPs with minor allele frequency<0.05 were filtered.
	
3.eQTLPro.R	
	Gene data preprocessing.The Affymetric probe name is converted to Gene Symbol.If there is the same gene name, the average value of gene expression is taken.
	The eQTL data will be named in the form of RS and Gene in the form of Symbol, and the SNP data and Gene data will be matched to remove the SNP and Gene data that are not in the eQTL.The association relationship of PPI network was mapped to gene association relationship.

4.gene_gene_matrix.py
	The correlation between genes generated by eQTLPro.R file is converted to matrix form.

5.SNP_gene_matrix.py
	The correlation between SNPs and genes generated by eQTLPro.R file is converted to matrix form.

6.G-EDNN.py
	Core algorithm code.
